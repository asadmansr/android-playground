## Calling Kotlin Code from Java

Annotations to change the way Kotlin generates its JVM bytecode, such as
- @JvmStatic - generate static members and methods
- @JvmOverloads - generate overloaded methods for function that have default values
- @JvmName - change the name of getters and setters
- @JvmField - expose a property directly as a field, rather than via getters and setters
- @Throws - declare checked exceptions
